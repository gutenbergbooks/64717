<p><span class="smcap">As</span> an aggregate of individuals
professing faith in Christ, we, the people of Great Britain, may
with truth and reason venture to assert that our Queen and our
Legislature are on a footing, as to God&rsquo;s protecting care,
with highly favoured and heaven-honoured David of old.&nbsp; If
Almighty God, under his earlier revelation, did actually guard
and help in temporal matters a ruling prince of this lower world,
who was a man &ldquo;after his own heart&rdquo;&mdash;as
David&rsquo;s plainly-told history everywhere assures us that He
did&mdash;none can reasonably say that it is either impossible or
improbable that He should vouchsafe to guard and help our
presiding Monarch and our law-giving Senate in the administration
of public affairs, baptized as they are &ldquo;in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;&rdquo; educated as
they are in the very details of his later <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and last
revelation; and supposed, pledged, and believed as they are to be
seeking <i>individually</i> after the mind which is in Christ,
and the sanctifying influence of the Holy Spirit of God.&nbsp;
All, indeed, must at once see, and grant as a foregone conclusion
from which there is no appeal, that our monarchical and
representative government, being <i>essentially</i> and
<i>generally Christian</i>&mdash;being so in spite of the
Judaism, vice, and infidelity which may be discerned in it, and
which in no way interfere with our present argument&mdash;is, by
virtue of its admitted and preponderating Christianity, brought
under the immediate guardianship and protection of the Most
High.</p>
<p>Such being the case, or since we believe such to be the case,
we most naturally, and, I may add most consistently, pray for the
&ldquo;High Court of Parliament&rdquo; which assembles from time
to time &ldquo;under our most religious and gracious
Queen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our prayer in this matter is as simple as it
is beautiful.&nbsp; A prayer is it which none who are in the
habit of praying at all for others can possibly object to.&nbsp;
It simply asks of God that He would &ldquo;be pleased to direct
and prosper all their consultations to the advancement of his
glory, the good of his church, the safety, honour, and welfare of
our Sovereign and her dominions.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Often and
often, let me trust, have we loyally and faithfully prayed after
this most becoming and time-hallowed fashion.&nbsp; Especially,
most especially, let me also trust, did we do so&mdash;I feel
confident that we did, if our hearts were not steeled against
every patriotic impression&mdash;some two years ago, in this very
place, as also in the still larger chamber of a thoughtful
spirit,&mdash;at a time which all must well remember,&mdash;a
time of deep national distress and heaviness of heart into which,
under God&rsquo;s fearful and probationary providence, we as a
people were cast headlong and unawares by the event of an Eastern
mutiny.&nbsp; Recall the occasion referred to.&nbsp; By so doing
we shall be reminded of the great need there then was for prayer
for help, and of the petition we then put up, and so be enabled
to appreciate more livingly and heartily the answer which God has
given us this day in the blessing of peace and restoration of
&ldquo;tranquillity in her Majesty&rsquo;s Indian
dominions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let memory&rsquo;s wand conjure up to our
imagination, or, if we please, let fancy&rsquo;s pencil sketch to
our view the scene, the hour, in which, at the period in
question, we had recourse, with more than ordinary interest and
earnestness, to prayer in our difficulty on behalf of our Queen
and Council of State&mdash;prayer to the effect that they might
be &ldquo;directed and prospered&rdquo; in all their <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>momentous
&ldquo;consultations&rdquo; on which, humanly speaking, hung the
dignity, the happiness, and the missionary usefulness as well as
the safety of our beloved country.&nbsp; You will suppose, then,
that we are just released from the cruel bondage of a warfare
into which we were compelled, as men of faith and feeling, to
enter for humanity&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Our laurels of awarded
victory are still fresh on the hero&rsquo;s brow.&nbsp; Our
triumphant attitude is, to all appearance, keeping at bay a
tyrant world, and securing &ldquo;peace on earth and goodwill
towards men.&rdquo;&nbsp; Time is about to commence her gracious
task of lessening our sorrows for the brave and bold who are no
more on earth amongst the children of men, and whose remains are
swelling with their sad accumulations the once unbroken, but now
grave-studded Crimean plain.&nbsp; Our minds are turning
homeward.&nbsp; We dwell upon reforming ourselves.&nbsp; Social
progress and fair play in all matters, ecclesiastical as well as
civil, are points which much interest us.&nbsp; We are musing
with practical intent upon such things as become enlightened and
well-disposed minds.&nbsp; We are thoroughly enjoying national
repose, dwelling each man &ldquo;safely under his own
vine;&rdquo; and we are doing, and anxious to do, the great, the
civilizing work of peace.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; &ldquo;All is vanity
and vexation of spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our fondest <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>hopes are
broken up, and, in a moment of time, vanish away as a vision of
the night when one awakes.&nbsp; A cry is heard abroad amongst
us; it is no less than a cry of war&mdash;that hell-cry which
despots love to raise, and which all godless and loveless spirits
echo in sympathetic sinfulness!&nbsp; At the gates of science do
we listen, in dread suspense, to hear the contradiction or
confirmation of the evil tidings.&nbsp; Our worst suspicions are
soon confirmed.&nbsp; In rapid successions does the magic whisper
steal across the deep, and tell its brief but bloody tale, that
ours have risen up against us in the far East; that many a bitter
Shimei has come forth to curse our rule; that many a mutinous and
rebel Sheba has blown the signal blast of insurrection; that men,
women, and children, &ldquo;bone of our bone, and flesh of our
flesh,&rdquo; are being scattered abroad by a cruelly organized
persecution, some seeking in hopeless flight a desert solitude,
there to die unfriended and alone; others hastening to the
nearest fastness, there to hold out, a scanty and surprised
handful, against an armed and swarming adversary; and that, once
more, numbers of our fellow-countrymen, together with their wives
and little ones, have actually perished, if not by more hideous
means, by the edge of the sword.&nbsp; A trembling for the
present, and a fear for the future, <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>take hold of us.&nbsp; With deepest
anxiety do we turn, in this our moment of sharp distress and
bewilderment, to our ruling representatives, bidding them do in
our common name what seemed to them good under the circumstances
of our emergency, and dismissing them to their onerous work with
the benedictory prayer, that Almighty God would of his infinite
goodness &ldquo;be pleased to direct and prosper all their
consultations to the advancement of his glory, the good of his
Church, the safety, honour, and welfare of our Sovereign and her
dominions.&rdquo;&nbsp; So it was, I doubt not, that we, as a
God-fearing people, prayed for our rulers when they were summoned
to consider and prepare for the suppression of that Indian mutiny
of 1857, whose simply detailed history is of itself, its plain,
unvarnished, unembellished self, the most cruel and the most
heart-rending tragedy that has ever been recorded!&nbsp; Of this
enough.</p>
<p>And now, my believing and prayer-using brethren&mdash;so I
would style you <i>all</i>&mdash;it is high time for me to
challenge your hearty attention to the joyous and indisputable
fact, that your reward for having prayed for your rulers is at
hand.&nbsp; Your petition on their behalf has been heard on high,
if petition on any national account be ever hearkened to above,
or if what we see before us is not the merest <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>coincidence
of blindest chance.&nbsp; Open wide your eyes, and read for
yourselves the heaven-sent answer to your prayer.&nbsp; Your
Sovereign&rsquo;s will, your senators&rsquo; wisdom, have both
alike worked marvellously well for you and yours.&nbsp; All their
consultations, resolutions, and decrees, in the matter of the
suppression of the Indian mutiny, have, up to the present moment,
been accompanied by that triple result which you have so often
prayed for&mdash;&ldquo;the advancement of God&rsquo;s glory, the
good of his Church, the safety, honour, and welfare of our
Sovereign and her dominions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let me somewhat enlarge.&nbsp; God&rsquo;s <i>glory</i>, we do
not hesitate to affirm, has been more or less advanced by the
conduct and policy of England in and during the warfare which has
been recently accomplished in the East.&nbsp; All that we have
done in it worthy of praise or remembrance, we have done, so we
believe and confess, through Him, through his strength, through
his teaching, through his Gospel, through the very circumstances
under which He has placed us, and through the very constitutional
dispositions which He has given us.&nbsp; All, therefore, that
has been done in it worthy of praise or remembrance, do we feel
bound to ascribe, purely and simply, to God, as its author and
finisher, entering as we did upon every work, <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>every
encounter, with these words of humility upon our
lips:&mdash;&ldquo;Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy
name, give glory, for Thy mercy and for Thy truth&rsquo;s
sake;&rdquo; and checking the thought of pride and
self-sufficiency which from time to time rose up within on
occasion of our having done well, with the apostolic inquiry and
reproof&mdash;&ldquo;Who maketh thee to differ from
another?&nbsp; And what hast thou that thou didst not
receive?&nbsp; Now, if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory
as if thou hadst not received it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much, indeed, from this point of view, does our national
behaviour in the East during unparalleled difficulties redound to
the <i>glory</i> of that God from whom all &ldquo;holy desires,
all good counsels, and all just works do proceed.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Never have we been in such straits.&nbsp; Never have we acted so
graciously and so in accordance with the spirit of our
Gospel.&nbsp; Before us stood&mdash;a sickening and
never-to-be-forgotten sight&mdash;a vast army in deadly and
rebellious array&mdash;an army made up of men with whom we had
gone side by side to victory over a common foe&mdash;men our
familiar friends, to whom we had extended, and were learning more
and more to extend, the right hand of social fellowship&mdash;men
whom we had not only treated kindly, but, as was reported and
believed, had verily spoiled by forbearing gentleness.&nbsp; <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>There they
stand&mdash;a rebellious horde&mdash;raging
&ldquo;furiously,&rdquo; and imagining a &ldquo;vain
thing,&rdquo; doing all they can, by slaying the innocent and
dishonouring the chaste, to tempt us to forget our nature and our
nature&rsquo;s God, and to assimilate ourselves to their unholy
and fiendish temperaments.&nbsp; Nothing, however, that they do
disturbs for a moment the balance of Christian power and
influence in our national and common mind.&nbsp; To war, indeed,
do we sally forth in saddest necessity and from a sense of duty,
but it is to a war of a <i>purely defensive</i> character on our
part, and nothing more.&nbsp; No hunting down the adversary, no
trampling upon him, no tearing away the suckling from the breast,
for the sweetness of being revenged, have characterized our
doings.&nbsp; Vengeance have we repudiated, or rather, I should
say, not dared to handle, being, as we conceive, an attribute
belonging solely to God, and too fearful to be entrusted to
fallen man.&nbsp; Here and there, it is true, the pulpit and the
press, losing their moral self-possession, raised awhile in our
hearing that ancient Christ-condemned cry of
retaliation&mdash;&ldquo;an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth;&rdquo; but soon, very soon, was that harsh and ugly sound
let die away and for ever perish in the softer strain of the Son
of God&mdash;&ldquo;But I say unto you, <i>that ye resist not
</i><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span><i>evil</i>; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right
cheek, turn to him the other also.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; No
vengeance, no retaliation&mdash;God&rsquo;s holy name be
praised&mdash;have stained the banner of England.&nbsp; We fought
honourably and for noble ends.&nbsp; We have slain, alas! but
only those on whom the law of God and the law of man would have
passed sentence of death, if required so to do.&nbsp; We have
fought, who can deny it? but fought that we might &ldquo;live and
let live&rdquo;&mdash;that the world might be peaceably
ordered&mdash;and that &ldquo;peace and happiness, truth and
justice, religion and piety,&rdquo; might be established amongst
us, amongst the people committed to our charge, even the hosts of
India, &ldquo;for all generations.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are ashamed
neither of our deeds nor our motives.&nbsp; They, indeed, are not
ours; this is <i>why</i> we are not ashamed of them&mdash;but as
we have said, they are God&rsquo;s&mdash;God&rsquo;s, that is, so
far as they are pure, holy, merciful, upright, manly&mdash;in a
word, so far as they are Christian.&nbsp; To Him, therefore, let
them be ascribed in the presence of the whole world, and from
them, as from a moral mirror, let there be reflected, not our
national, but his everlasting &ldquo;Glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inseparably connected with the glory of God, which has in a
measure been worked out, as we maintain, by the events to which
we refer, is the <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;good of his Church&rdquo;&mdash;a result we ever
pray may attend all our political consultations and
movements.&nbsp; Who can doubt that the spectacle presented to
the Indian mind in all our transactions of war&mdash;our wisdom,
our mercy, our justice&mdash;is doing its silent work in many a
thoughtful bosom, and adding some new soul to the Church of
Christ even whilst we are speaking?&nbsp; Many and many a man,
depend upon it, has been made to think for himself, in these
troublous times, of the real value and working of his ancestral
creed.&nbsp; He has often, may be, had doubts as to the
superstitions of his nation, and the doctrines of his
overseers.&nbsp; He has for years, perhaps, held in secret and
deep admiration the aspirations and longings of his natural
conscience, and felt that they ran counter to the senseless
commandments and idle traditions of the world with which he and
his race have been overburdened.&nbsp; He has longed for a creed
which should not suppress and smother, but fan into a living
flame of sterling piety, those smouldering elements of natural
religion which he has treasured amidst the follies of heathenism
on the hearth of a not yet abandoned conscience.&nbsp; His wish
is gratified.&nbsp; He has at length found, or rather, we should
say, seen at work, such a creed&mdash;seen it in the warrior of
the Cross, seen it in one who can fight and yet be merciful, <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>who can have
within his power a cruel relentless enemy, yet find room for
compassion; who can show at all times and in all places that he
has a heart which beats true to the instincts of our nature, when
not lost and sensualized.&nbsp; He has rejoiced with exceeding
great joy to have fallen in with a religion which is far from
contradicting conscience or nature, but which, contrariwise,
advocates and enforces &ldquo;whatsoever things are true,
whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good
report;&rdquo; things which even in his childhood&rsquo;s
superstitions and the ignorance of his more advanced years have
never altogether forsaken him.&nbsp; He has pondered over these
things in his heart, and contrasting the plain, true, useful life
of the Cross, with the wicked follies and fancies of the
Crescent, has yielded himself up to the former, and added himself
to the Church of Christ.&nbsp; May it have been so in many, many
instances!</p>
<p>As to the last result of legislative labour on our behalf,
&ldquo;the safety, honour, and welfare of our Sovereign and her
dominions,&rdquo; which we prayed might follow our rulers&rsquo;
consultations, it is needless to say anything.&nbsp; Each of us
can see the finger of <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>God at work in, and trace its divine
impress upon, the facts of to-day, which call us together to
thank and praise the Lord.&nbsp; Each has faith and wit enough of
soul, let us believe, to read, in the spirit of the words of the
text, the manner in which God has been with our Sovereign, our
national interests, yea! ourselves&mdash;&ldquo;<i>And the Lord
preserved David whithersoever he went</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, my brethren, what is the most appropriate
thank-offering that we, Sovereign and people, can make to
Almighty God for his mercies vouchsafed to us?&nbsp; Undoubtedly
that which follows up our advantages and shows that we are
worthy, or labouring to be thought worthy, of the great position
with which God has entrusted us, even the thank-offering which
David made after his preservation, and which is unpretendingly
recorded in the words, &ldquo;And David executed judgment and
justice to all his people.&rdquo;&nbsp; This it is ours to see
carried out, so far as in us lies, and this we trust is being
carried out fully and conscientiously by our representatives.</p>
<p>But something more have we to offer up to God than judgment
and justice toward the people subject to our rule, though this
offering be great and to be had in highest esteem.&nbsp; We have
heard and seen <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>what kings and prophets desired of old to hear and
see.&nbsp; Our knowledge is increased, and so is our
responsibility.&nbsp; All type, all figure, all mystery, are
removed from us, and &ldquo;God, who at sundry times, and in
divers manners, spake in time past unto the fathers by the
prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his
Son&rdquo;&mdash;spoken a word of salvation in the Gospel which
exceeds, in point of moral beauty and spiritual comfort, all that
we can imagine or desire.&nbsp; This word we dare not enjoy to
ourselves.&nbsp; On we must pass it, together with judgment and
justice, to our people.&nbsp; It has made us great, and caused us
to &ldquo;shine like lights in the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why should
it not make them so, and cause them so to shine?&nbsp; On we must
pass it, not only as a matter of ordinary and evident duty, but
as a matter of feeling.&nbsp; Each true believer is, by his very
impulse of faith, a soul-seeking power amongst men.&nbsp; In his
heart is deeply sown the missionary germ&mdash;only requiring the
light and heat of a living faith to raise and mature it to its
appointed height and grandeur&mdash;when its branches are sure to
spread themselves forth in sheltering love over all living within
their reach.</p>
<p>To this passing on of blessings received to others are we ever
invited.&nbsp; Now, this very day, are we <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>so
especially.&nbsp; &ldquo;A great door and effectual&rdquo; is
open to us in the East.&nbsp; By the violence of
circumstances&mdash;circumstances, those emissaries of the great
Creator&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;have the gates of superstition been
torn from their hinges, and a way made for us to enter,
unmolested, into the very sanctuary and stronghold of Belial,
there to preach to our heart&rsquo;s content &ldquo;the way, the
truth, and the life.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is as if an
angel&mdash;opportunity had been sent from on high to
&ldquo;prepare the way of the Lord,&rdquo; and had cried aloud to
the long pent-up and isolated heathen world to receive
us&mdash;the <i>missionary nation of the Cross of Christ</i>;
saying unto them, &ldquo;Open ye the gates, that the righteous
nation which keepeth truth may enter in.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh! who is
there amongst us that does not now desire to enter in?&nbsp; Who
is there that does not sorrow over his indolence in not having
done more hitherto for his fellows?&nbsp; Who does not burn with
indignation at his own&mdash;his country&rsquo;s&mdash;missionary
apathy, when he contemplates before him, in India and her
immortal millions, a vast sea of souls, now surging with
infidelity, now again raging with superstition, bearing as it
does on its sin-heaving and lust-swelling surface but few, very

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
